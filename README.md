🚀 Gas Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project focuses on predicting natural gas prices using Linear Regression. The dataset contains monthly gas prices, and the goal is to analyze trends and forecast future prices.

📊 Features & Methodology
🔹 Data Preprocessing

Converts dates into Ordinal format for numerical representation
Splits data into training & testing sets
Normalizes data for better model performance
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Scatter plots to visualize trends
Correlation analysis to check linearity
Identifies seasonal patterns
🔹 Machine Learning Model Used
✅ Linear Regression – A simple and effective model to capture trends and forecast future prices.

📈 Visualization
Plots actual vs. predicted prices
Displays a forecasted trendline
Evaluates model performance with R² Score & Mean Squared Error (MSE)
